# vflow Brainstorm — Requirements Discovery

Systematic requirements discovery before design. Reduces low-value questions, surfaces hidden scope, and converges to a clear, agreed requirement.

## Input Contract

- User's task description
- Project codebase and (if present) `.vflow/config.json`
- Output target: conversation conclusions, or a user-specified file. When an active vflow proposal exists, conclusions feed the `understand` node's scope statement.

## Steps

### 1. Auto-Context [required·once]

Before asking the user anything, gather context yourself:

- Inspect code, configs, and docs related to the task topic
- Locate existing patterns, similar features, conventions
- Note constraints (dependencies, build tooling, API contracts)
- Check `.vflow/spec/` for relevant domain knowledge (if it exists)

Write findings into the conversation as a brief summary: "Here's what I already know from the codebase: ..."

### 2. Gated Questions [required·repeatable]

For each potential question, run the gate before asking:

| Gate | Check | If yes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A: Derivable? | Can I answer this from code, config, docs, or quick inspection? | Don't ask — derive it, state your finding |
| B: Meta? | Is this "should I search?" / "can you paste the code?" | Don't ask — take action directly |
| C: Type? | Is this Blocking (cannot proceed) or Preference (multiple valid choices)? | Ask only Blocking or Preference questions |

Rules:
- **One question per message** — never stack multiple questions
- **Prefer AskUserQuestion** with concrete options over open-ended text questions
- **For preference questions**: present 2-3 specific approaches with trade-offs, not "what do you want?"
- After each answer: immediately restate the conclusion so it's captured

### 3. Diverge Sweep [required·once]

After core requirements are understood, proactively expand thinking before converging. Present one message with 1-2 bullets per category:

1. **Future evolution** — What might this feature become in 1-3 months? What extension points are worth preserving now?
2. **Related scenarios** — What adjacent features should remain consistent? Parity expectations?
3. **Failure & edge cases** — Conflicts, data loss risks, idempotency, input validation, rollback

**5W1H blind-spot scan** — After the 3 categories above, run a quick 6-dimension check to catch gaps the categories missed:

| Dimension | Check Question |
| :--- | :--- |
| **What** | Is the deliverable clearly defined? Any ambiguity in what "done" means? |
| **Why** | Is the motivation documented? Would a different person reach the same conclusion about why this is needed? |
| **When** | Are there timing constraints, dependencies, or ordering requirements not yet captured? |
| **Where** | Which modules/layers/systems are affected? Any cross-boundary impacts missed? |
| **Who** | Who are the consumers of this change? Any stakeholders or downstream users not considered? |
| **How** | Is the implementation approach clear? Any unresolved technical choices? |

If any dimension reveals a gap, add it to the diverge list. If all 6 are covered, state "5W1H: no additional gaps found."

Ask the user (via AskUserQuestion): "Which of these should be in MVP scope?"

Record the outcome:
- Selected items → requirements / acceptance criteria
- Excluded items → out of scope (explicit)

Skip this step if the task is genuinely simple (single-file change with clear scope) — state "Diverge sweep skipped: scope is narrow and unambiguous."

### 4. Converge [required·once]

Produce the final requirement summary with all sections:
- Original requirement
- Q&A log (question + answer)
- Requirement conclusions: goal, in-scope, out-of-scope, acceptance criteria

Deliver it to the conversation (or the user-specified file). When an active vflow proposal exists, fold goal/scope/constraints into the proposal's `understand` node.

Confirm with the user: "Requirements are captured. Proceeding to design."

## Output Template

After step 1:
"🔍 Auto-context complete: found {N} relevant files/patterns. {key finding}."

After step 3:
"🔀 Diverge sweep: {N} items across 3 categories. Which belong in MVP?"

After step 4:
"✅ Requirements captured. Next: Design."

## Guardrails

- Never ask a question that fails all three gates — derive the answer yourself
- Never present more than one question per message
- AskUserQuestion is the preferred mechanism for all "user must decide" moments
- Do not skip the diverge sweep for non-trivial tasks unless scope is genuinely narrow (state the reason)
- Synthesize conclusions — do not dump raw auto-context output as the requirement
