# vflow-commit — Smart Commit

Classify changes → suggest splits → generate Chinese commit message → one-shot confirmation → execute.

## Flow

### Stage 1: Repository Validation

1. Confirm inside a git repo, no rebase/merge in progress
2. `git status` + `git diff` (staged and unstaged) to gather all changes

### Stage 2: Change Classification [required]

Split dirty files into two categories — **never silently commit the second**:

- **Session-related**: Files edited in this session + associated task archives (`.vflow/tasks/`)
- **Unrecognized**: Files not touched in this session (may be manual edits or parallel work) → list and ask whether to include, default exclude

### Stage 3: Split Suggestions

Cluster by concern (source / test / docs / task archive). If multiple independent change groups detected (>300 lines spanning multiple top-level directories), suggest splitting into multiple commits with a grouping plan; proceed as single commit if user declines.

### Stage 4: Generate Commit Message

Follow project conventions (Chinese commit messages):

```
类型: 简短描述

- 要点（可选，动机/影响范围）

任务: <vflow task ID, e.g. 06-12-roundness-algo (when active/just-archived task exists)>
```

Types: feat/fix/refactor/docs/test/chore. First line ≤72 characters.

**Desensitization check**: Scan staged content for token/key/password/secret patterns. If suspicious → stop and warn.

### Stage 5: One-Shot Confirmation [HARD STOP]

Show complete plan (file list + commit message), wait for user response:
- "ok" / "可以" / "行" → execute
- "我自己来" / "manual" → abort, don't generate second version
- Other feedback → adjust based on feedback and re-show

### Stage 6: Execute

```bash
git add <explicit file list>   # never git add -A
git commit -m "<message>"
git log --oneline -1           # echo confirmation
```

## Hard Rules

1. Don't commit unrecognized files without explicit user consent
2. Don't use --no-verify / --force; hook failure → fix issue then new commit, no --amend
3. Don't push (push requires separate user request)
4. One commit = one concern
